# Screenautomation
I was using selenium for a long time and getting profficient at it and found it to be lacking at automating many websites due to it being detected by anti-bot software
I decided to try a new route using opencv to take screenshots of the monitor and using pyautogui to automate the mouse and keyboard.  
Here is my beginning code and I'll add more functionalities as I need.
You can search for items on the screen by text and or by taking a screenshot of an image on your screen and adding it to your local files to include the path in the find_and_click_image function.
